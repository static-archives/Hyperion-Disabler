# The Hyperion Disabler
A complete "full-fledged" bypass for hyperion that I wrote because I was bored :p
But no really, this disables the integrity checker and hooks the instrumentation callback, rendering hyperion defenseless.
It then allows you to modify tls callbacks, hook every syscall, and it even contains a full bypass for hardware breakpoints.
