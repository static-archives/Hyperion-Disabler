# The Hyperion Disabler
A complete "full-fledged" bypass for hyperion that I wrote because I was bored :p
<br>
But no really, this disables the integrity checker and hooks the instrumentation callback, rendering hyperion defenseless.
<br>
It then allows you to modify tls callbacks, hook every syscall, and it even contains a full bypass for hardware breakpoints.
